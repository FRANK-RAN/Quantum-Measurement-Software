/*
 * File: NamedPipeServer.cpp
 * Description: This file contains functions to create and manage a named pipe server in Windows.
 *              The server waits for a client to connect, handles incoming requests, and sends
 *              data segments or other responses based on the client's request.
 *
 * Functions:
 * - createAndConnectPipe: Creates a named pipe and waits for a client to connect.
 * - CheckForRequest: Checks if data is available from the client without blocking.
 * - handleClientRequests: Handles requests from the client, including starting the experiment,
 *                         sending data, and stopping the data acquisition.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Compile this file as part of your application that interacts with named pipes.
 *
 * Author: Frank Ran
 * Created: 2024-11-13
 
 
 * Notes:
 * - Ensure the client application connects to the same named pipe for proper communication.
 * - Customize the buffer size and request handling logic as needed.

/*
 * Function: createAndConnectPipe
 * Description: Creates a named pipe with read/write access and waits for a client to connect.
 * Parameters:
 *   - pipeName: The name of the pipe (const char*) used to identify the pipe.
 *   - bufferSize: The size of the pipe's buffer in bytes (DWORD).
 * Returns:
 *   - HANDLE: A handle to the created pipe. Returns NULL if the pipe creation or connection fails.
 * Notes:
 *   - The function blocks until a client connects to the pipe.
 *   - The created pipe has duplex (read/write) access with byte-based communication.

/*
 * Function: CheckForRequest
 * Description: Checks if the client has sent any data to the server without blocking.
 * Parameters:
 *   - hPipe: A handle to the pipe (HANDLE) to check for available data.
 * Returns:
 *   - bool: Returns true if data is available to read; false otherwise.
 * Notes:
 *   - Uses PeekNamedPipe to check for data without removing it from the pipe.

/*
 * Function: handleClientRequests
 * Description: Handles requests from the client connected to the named pipe. Depending on the request,
 *              the function may start or stop the experiment, or send data back to the client.
 * Parameters:
 *   - hPipe: A handle to the pipe (HANDLE) for communication.
 *   - data: Pointer to an array of short integers (short*) containing the raw signals data to send.
 *   - corrMatrix: Pointer to an array of doubles (double*) representing the correlation matrix to send.
 *   - segmentIndex: The index (int) of the data segment to send.
 *   - bytesToSend: The number of bytes to send (DWORD) from the `data` array, which means the number pf signal points sent.
 * Returns:
 *   - int: Status code indicating the result:
 *          - 0: No data to process.
 *          - 1: Error occurred (e.g., reading or writing data).
 *          - 2: Experiment start requested.
 *          - 3: Data sent successfully.
 *          - 4: Experiment stop requested.
 * Notes:
 *   - This function calls CheckForRequest to verify if the client has sent data.
 *   - The function uses `ReadFile` and `WriteFile` to read from and write to the pipe.
